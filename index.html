									<p class="card-text">With mixed feelings we are saying goodbye to the ESDN name. The IoT platform developed and managed by the Center for IoT Engineering and Innovation (CIEI) is now called:<br><strong>Platform for IoT Open Networks (PITON).</strong><br><br> The renaming is a natural reflection of our growth. While we continue to support environment focused project, we now support smart city, smart agriculture, and smart healthcare solutions. Operationally, we are developing the platform in an open network model where we accommodate infrastructure investments made by partner organizations along with the infrastructure expansion funded and driven by CIEI.  We coined the term Campus as a Lab for our initial deployment, we expanded it to City and County as a Lab through partnerships with local communities and we are now pursuing plans to enable the entire Eastern North Carolina for IoT. We are also working on several strategic partnerships while we continue to improve the platform, add new features and optimize usability. If you want to stay informed on the latest CIEI and PITON developments, <a href="#newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a>. <br><br>We want to thank all our partners for their collaboration, and we want to thank ECU's Department of Technology Systems and College of Engineering for their continued, long-term support. Our mission is to enable Eastern North Carolina to drive economic development, to improve the quality of its environment, to improve the health of its communities and to create new job and entrepreneurship opportunities by taking advantage of the Internet of Things revolution.

Representatives from the city of Greenville and the Greenville Utilities Commission visited the Center for IoT engineering and Innovation to lean about the Platform for IoT Open Networks and opportunities to collaborate on the development of IoT based solutions for the local community. Amongst the participants were city manager Mrs. Ann Wall, deputy city manager Mr. Michal Cowin, assistant city manager Mr. Ken Graves, director of IT Mr. Matt Haga, director of public works, Mr. Kevin Mulligan, engineering director Mrs. Lisa Kirby, fire-rescue chief Mr. Carson Sanders, police department chief Mr. Ted Sauls, recreation and parks director Mr. Don Octigan and assistant director of public works Mr. Kevin Heifferon. The Greenville Utilities Commission was represented by director of IT Mr. Andy Anderson and operations support manager Mr. Kevin Keyzer.<br><br>The CIEI team reviewed the many resources available at ECU to support IoT innovation and to provide examples of possible potential projects on the current footprint of PITON. Along with the PITON platform, the center provides support for technology integration, it can bring subject matter experts from across ECU to help with the development of solutions and it can leverage students to support implementation. The event included a visit to the PITON Network Operations Center where our guests could see how the platform is being monitored and managed.<br><br>The questions and points raised by the city officials demonstrated their commitment to constantly searching for solutions to the issues faced by the city, to improving the health and well-being of the community. The city of Greenville management team is committed to innovation and collaborating with East Carolina University which opens the door for a partnership with significant positive results for the community.</p>

									<p class="card-text">The CIEI team in collaboration with Dr. Sinan Sousan in the Department of Public Health and his research team integrated three types of low-cost air quality sensors with the PITON Compute Shim. This integration facilitated the easy field deployment of the sensors and the collection of live data through the PITON platform.  
										</br></br>The main goal of the project is to evaluate and calibrate low-cost sensors against more expensive equipment and assess their accuracy and reliability in the field. Three PITON compute shims (CS) were deployed, each connected to three low-cost sensors, one of each sensor types. The CS connect to PITON where data is collected and displayed for analysis. Two expensive, highly accurate air quality sensors were deployed at the same location as references. 
										</br></br>The secondary goal of the project is to explore the feasibility of miniaturized, LoRa connected air quality sensors that could be used to collect environmental information with the help of local communities. This concept will be explored once the evaluation of the low-cost, small form factor air quality sensors is completed.

									<p class="card-text">The Platform for IoT Open Networks (PITON) was architected from day one to support four use cases:
										</br></br>1.	Bring your own sensor and we will connect it to the PITON LoRaWAN network with the help of the compute shim
										</br>2.	Bring your LoRaWAN enabled sensor and we will connect it to the PITON network
										</br>3.	Bring your entire sensor deployment with its own communication network (for example cellular) and we will bring the collected data live into PITON
										</br>4.	Bring your own data sets and we will import them into PITON
										</br>
										</br>For the past year we worked hard to deploy the LoRaWAN infrastructure and to set up the service that supports the first three scenarios. We recently demonstrated the support of Scenario 4 by continually importing data from a Zentra database through HTTP API requests. This implementation supports on of our user groups, enabling them to bring together data collected from legacy infrastructures and data collected over the PITON network.  
										</br></br>This integration brings us one step closer to our goal of making PITON a central repository of research data, a platform for collaboration regardless of the way data is collected.

The power plant and the LoRaWAN communications shim integration was tested in the PITON labs and it is the result of the collaboration with the Water Resources Center.
